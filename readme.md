# 🔍 About the Project
This repository contains my submission for the ASBA Predictive Analytics Competition (2025) on Kaggle. The aim was to build a predictive model estimating Airbnb listing prices in Melbourne, using real listing features. This challenge replicates a full analytical workflow—like you'd use in real-world business forecasting.

# 🗂 Dataset
- Training set: ~7,000 listings
- Test set: ~3,000 listings (no price labels)
- Target: price (numeric, in AUD)
- Evaluation metric: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) — lower is better.
- Submission format: Two-column CSV (ID, price) without currency symbols.
  
# 🎯 Key Objectives
- Understand and prepare the Airbnb listing data
- Engineer meaningful features (e.g. location, room type, number of amenities)
- Build regression models to minimize MAE
- Validate results via Kaggle’s public and final leaderboard
